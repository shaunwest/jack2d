Layer? get rid of this concept?


Renderer
- renders 2d (and 3d?) content
- renders above all previously added renderers
- can have a viewport for clipping content that shouldn't be visible
- needs to be tied to an HTML element, usually a div

Viewport
- gets passed to a Renderer rather than being tied to an HTML element
- has viewport dimensions as well as deltaX/Y
- any renderer can take a advantage of these values


StreamCanvas



getSegment(x, y)
    - if a canvas exists for this position return it
    - if it doesn't exist create one and return it

    applying a single image to multiple canvases
